## Introduction

This project is a Python-based visualization of the N-Queens problem, a classic puzzle involving placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Utilizing Pygame, this tool provides a step-by-step visualization of the algorithm solving the N-Queens problem, showcasing the placement and backtracking of queens.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and Pygame installed. You can install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

To start the visualization, run the script from your command line:

```bash
python main_UI.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to input the number of queens (N) and start the visualization.


## Dependencies

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Pygame


## Examples

To run the program with 8 queens, simply start the program and enter `8` when prompted for the number of queens.
